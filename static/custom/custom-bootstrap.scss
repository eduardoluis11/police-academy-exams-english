/* Custom Bootstrap Sass to generate custom CSS styles for Bootstrap.

I will use this to override the btn-primary and btn-secondary Boostrap classes, alongside any other classes that I may
want to edit.

Method 1: Modify Bootstrap Using Sass (Recommended)
1. Set Up Sass Compilation
Install Sass: You’ll need the Sass compiler to convert .scss files to .css. On PythonAnywhere or locally:
bash

npm install -g sass

If you don’t have Node.js on PythonAnywhere, you can install it locally on your machine, compile the CSS, and upload
the result to PythonAnywhere. Alternatively, use PythonAnywhere’s Bash console to install a Dart Sass binary:

Verify Installation:


2. Create a Custom Sass File
Instead of editing Bootstrap’s _variables.scss directly (which can cause issues if you update Bootstrap later), create
a custom Sass file to override the variables.

In your static/ directory, create a new folder and file:

In custom-bootstrap.scss, import Bootstrap’s variables, override the colors, and then import the rest of Bootstrap:

You can choose any colors that match your app’s design (use a color picker tool or hex codes like #RRGGBB).

3. Compile the Custom Sass File
Compile custom-bootstrap.scss into a CSS file:

This generates custom-bootstrap.css with your new colors applied to btn-primary and btn-secondary.

4. Update Your Django Template
In your Django templates (e.g., base.html), replace the default Bootstrap CSS with your custom CSS:


Ensure static files are configured in settings.py:

On PythonAnywhere, set up static file mappings:

Run python manage.py collectstatic to serve the new CSS.

5. Test the Changes
Reload your app and check buttons with btn-primary (e.g., “Submit Exam”) and btn-secondary (e.g., “Cancel”). They
should now use your new colors (#ff4500 and #228b22, respectively).

Test hover, focus, and disabled states to ensure they look good (Bootstrap automatically adjusts these based on the
new $primary and $secondary).

I will use a color palette taken from Yassen Shopov's Pokemon Palette from https://www.pokemonpalette.com/. I'll
try using Regice's color palette. However, I may change it later.

I decided to use Kyogre Primal's color palette instead:
Primary: #1457a3
Secondary: #d5d5c6
Accent: #141833

This not only modifies the color for the btn-primary class, but all of other Boostrap classe that use the "-primary",
"-secondary", and "-warning" classes (for instance, "bg-primary" and "bg-secondary", which is used for the navbar's
color).

// Override Bootstrap variables to change these Bootstrap classes
$primary: #1457a3; // New color for btn-primary and "bg-primary" (the "primary color" from Pokemon Palette)
$secondary: #d5d5c6; // New color for btn-secondary and "bg-secondary" ("secondary color" from Pokemon Palette)
$warning: #141833; // New color for btn-warning and and "bg-warning" ("accent" from Pokemon Palette)
